`iofogctl` is a CLI for the installation, configuration, and operation of ioFog 
[Edge Compute Networks](https://iofog.org/docs/2/getting-started/core-concepts.html) (ECNs).
It can be used to remotely manage multiple ECNs from a single host. It is built for ioFog users and DevOps engineers 
wanting to manage ECNs. It is modelled on existing tools such as Terraform or kubectl that can be used to automate
infrastructure-as-code.

### Autocomplete

If you are running BASH or ZSH, iofogctl comes with shell autocompletion scripts.
In order to generate those scripts, run:

```bash
iofogctl autocomplete bash
```
OR

```bash
iofogctl autocomplete zsh
```

Then follow the instructions output by the command.

Example:
```bash
iofogctl autocomplete bash
âœ” $HOME/.iofog/completion.bash.sh generated
Run `source $HOME/.iofog/completion.bash.sh` to update your current session
Add `source $HOME/.iofog/completion.bash.sh` to your bash profile to have it saved

source $HOME/.iofog/completion.bash.sh
echo "$HOME/.iofog/completion.bash.sh" >> $HOME/.bash_profile
```

## Build from Source

This project uses go modules so it must be built from outside of your $GOPATH.

Go 1.16+ is a prerequisite. Install all other dependancies with:
```
make bootstrap
```
Make sure that your `$PATH` contains `$GOBIN`, otherwise `make build` will fail on the basis that command `rice` is not found.

See all `make` commands by running:
```
make
```

To build and install, go ahead and run:
```
make build install
iofogctl --help
```

iofogctl is installed in `/usr/local/bin`

## Running Tests

Run project unit tests:
```
make test
```

This will output a JUnit compatible file into `reports/TEST-iofogctl.xml` that can be imported in most CI systems.

## Embed assets

Run project build:
```
make build
```
